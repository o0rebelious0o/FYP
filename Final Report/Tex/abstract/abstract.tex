This project concerns the design and implementation of a proof of concept centralised communication platform which can be used by Examination invigilators to simplify the invigilation process, improve efficiency of how examinations are conducted and so bettering the experience for both students and staff.

The focus of the system is to provide an easily extensible framework for the system which can be extended with additional functionality as required, and offer a simple user experience which even those asked to invigilate at the last minute with little to no experience can work easily, making their experience as stress free as possible.

Having reviewed the options for technologies and platforms, it was decided that the system would comprise of a central Node.JS server to which Android client applications can connect and communicate via the Websockets Protocol.

The implemented system draws exam schedules and seating plans from existing data sources in the department of computing, processes them and shares them with the client application for visual representation and offering the ability to interact with the system such such as starting and stopping exams, pausing or adding extra time, which are immediately reflected on other client devices.  The client application also allows direct communication between connected users, and a platform to perform administrative tasks such as taking the student attendence register, or completing the post session report form, the results of which can be directly shared with the administrative staff, reducing beurocratic overhead and overlap between multiple systems, as well as reducing traditional paper based duties.

To evaluate the success of the system, I met and conducted evaluation interviews with a number of individuals involved with the exam invigilation process but removed from the system development to reflect upon both the functionality of the system and the user experience from the position of someone potentially using it.

A number of ways in which the current system could be expanded and extended in future are considered, as well as ways in which the current implementation could be refined or improved.
