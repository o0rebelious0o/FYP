% This template requires the labbook.cls file to be in the same directory as the
% .tex file. The labbook.cls file provides the necessary structure to create the

%
% The \lipsum[#] commands throughout this template generate dummy text

%
% HOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE 
% Each day in the lab consists of three main things:
%
% 1. LABDAY: The first thing to put is the \labday{} command with a date in 
% curly brackets, this will make a new page and put the date in big letters 
% at the top.
%
% 2. EXPERIMENT: Next you need to specify what experiment(s) you are 
% working on with an \experiment{} command with the experiment shorthand 
% in the curly brackets. The experiment shorthand is defined in the 
% 'DEFINITION OF EXPERIMENTS' section below, this means you can 
% say \experiment{pcr} and the actual text written to the PDF will be what 
% you set the 'pcr' experiment to be. If the experiment is a one off, you can 
% just write it in the bracket without creating a shorthand. Note: if you don't 
% want to have an experiment, just leave this out and it won't be printed.
%
% 3. CONTENT: Following the experiment is the content, i.e. what progress 
% you made on the experiment that day.

\experiment{introduction}

I know that I actually began work on my FYP a lot sooner that the date shown here, but I was a bit lazy and didn't begin to keep a log book before now.  I haven't done a lot over the past term as I had a huge amount of coursework ongoing non-stop.  I will progress from now keeping proper record of what I do to make the writing of the final report easier.

\experiment{prior_work}

I have already completed a number of investigative steps for this coursework which I will quickly run over here.

I have already completed an investigation into the requirements of this project to compile a list of aims and objectives of what features the system implemented should have.  For this I conducted a number of face to face interviews with exam invigilators and head examiners.  I then created a simple surver which was completed by a number of staff involved with the examination process in both the Department of Computing and Electronic and Electrical engineering at Imperial.

With a list of aims and objective for feature implementation rated according to usefulness by the people that will use the system, I then prioritised the features into three distinct functionality goals, basic, necessary for the project to be considered successful, advanced, for desirable features and stretch goals which will be implemented should there be sufficient time.

With goals decided, I then created some initial design sketches of the application drawn to scale to give an idea of how the application could look and how the layout would look.

I then began experimenting with different technologies that could be used to see how to progress with implentation.

\experiment{technology_investigation}

There were multiple ways I could have implemented inter client communication including HTTP Long-polling, AJAX or technologies such as XMPP.  When I looked into these technologies, I realised that they were inefficient or did not provide the functionality required for the system.  Even XMPP, designed for chat clients, did not offer the features for communication the system would require.

I decided that I would make use of a (relatively) new technology, websockets.  Initially I thought I would make use of Socket.IO, running on Node.JS, an implementation of websockets wrapped with a protocol layer which would be useful and make my work simpler.  I found, however, that Socket.IO did not have any compatible android implementations.  It was therefore necessary to find a more basic websockets implementation and implement a higher level protocol myself.

I installed the following packages on a CloudStack Ubuntu 12.04 server:

\begin{itemize}
\item Node.JS v0.10.26
\item Node Package Manager (npm) v1.4.3
\item Websockets (ws) v0.4.31
\end{itemize}

For the android counterpart app, I am using the Android-Studio to develop with the Google Nexus 7 tablet in mind as the target device.

I am making use of the following libraries for the android code.

\begin{itemize}
\item targetSdkVersion 19
\item autobahn-0.5.0
\item jackson-core-asl-1.9.7
\item jackson-mapper-asl-1.9.7
\end{itemize}

\experiment{day_heading}

Today I have been busy catching up on where the project was left off as well as creating this log book and filling in previous work.

I have updated the version of Android Studio from 0.4.4 to 0.5.6 and done the accompanying changes to the android code necessary to make it compile under the new version.

I have then proceeded to look back through the existing node.JS app, and android code to refamiliarise with the code already written and to decide which direction to take next.

The server can currently set up a websockets listener and respond to incoming requests.  It supports identifying multiple users and passing information between clients based upon a simple API which defines the nature of the message received from a client.  The Android app is able to connect the Websockets server, identify itself and send messages to all other users connected to the server.

\experiment{auth}

One of the key features of the system which I am as yet to look into is authentication of users on the system.  I had previously contacted IT and the CSG teams and discussed the various college authentication services available.

Available platforms:

\begin{itemize}
\item Kerberos
\item Active Directory
\item LDAP
\end{itemize}

Kerberos, used for single sign on, isn't what I want, and so I was left to investigate LDAP and active directory.  Having taken a look around, I found a node.JS library called node-active directory which looks like it should do what I want.

\experiment{node_tutorial}

In prior work I had rushed into quick investigations of the technologies I though would best suit the puposes of the project.  I am now going back to basics with Node.JS to begin with to get a better grasp of how it works and make sure I really understand node and how it works, and how best to use it.  The tutorials walked through writing basic console output, launching a basic HTTP server to listen on a port, through more advanced topics, async callback functions, creating node modules which can be included in apps and making use of post and get request parameters.

\experiment{node_active_directory}

Having got to grips with basic node.js topics, I moved on to investigate Active Exchange Authentication on Node.JS by creating a simple webpage on which you enter college credentials, and when submitted moves to a new page which does the LDAP authentication attempt and informs as to whether the LDAP auth was successful.

I did this using the node-activedirectory library I found yesterday.

I create an active directory object by binding to my own college credentials which are stored in their own node package to be included.  I then parse the received Post variables to extract the sent username and password, and do an LDAP authentication by attempting to bind the provided credentials.

This took a couple of hours to get working but works successfully and was relatively simple.  I spent a while before realising that the credentials provided need to have a fully qualified username, i.e <uname>@IC.AC.UK.  Once I appended this to the passed username, the system worked perfectly.

With the websocket aspect of the system working already following past work, and now college authentication working using LDAP, it should be possible to begin planning an implementation in greater detail.

\experiment{node_websockets_LDAP}

At this point I have websockets working on both the node.js server, and in an Android application.  The behaviour of the websockets server can be verified through either a direct websockets connection such as using the chrome extension Dark WebSocket Terminal, or through a connection from an Android Application configured to connect to it.

I will now attempt to create a sample hybrid application to figure out how to create a protocol handshake such that new users connecting to the server will authenticate with it and be kicked if they fail.  Only then they can proceed to communicate with other users via the server.  If they attempt to negotiate with the server without authenticating they should also be kicked.

Great website for generating JSON strings easily: http://www.objgen.com/json

I have designed the protocol to work with a structure such as below, where the header is defined, but the payload can vary according to the nature of the packet.

\begin{lstlisting}
header
  type
  sender
  receiver
payload
  username
  password
  message
 \end{lstlisting}

 After a days work I have a server which is able to have multiple clients connect, authenticate them and kick if they misbehave.  Messages can be sent between connected users using the protocol laid out above.  Users can request to be disconnected from the server and it will be gracefully dealt with.

 \labday{Wednesday, 9 April 2014}

 \experiment{android_chat_initial}

 Having had almost a week off through illness and being on holiday for my Birthday, I came back to uni to continue with work on the project.

 With a working backend that has been verified by directly communicating using the websockets terminal in chrome, I began to work on an android application and basic user interfacce for a chat based application which allows me to pull in the work so far together to add android to the equation and see how that works out.

 I am using a single android application containing a FragmentContainer that will be updated to show the user interface.  Initially I am working on being able to do the login to the system.

 The user interface has two EditTexts, one for username, one for password.  When the Connect button is pressed the activity talks to the WebSocketClient class and negotiates a connection to the websocket server.  It then does the initial authentication protocol handshake, allowing it to be authenticated against the college LDAP server.

 By the end of the day I have the user interface made up and the app is able to connect, authenticate (this shows on the server terminal out) and that is it.

 \labday{Thursday, 10 April 2014}

 \experiment{android_chat_continued}

 Building on yesterday's work, I continued with the application, adding the actual chat screen itself with a simple scrollable TextView, an EditText for message input, and a submit button.  It is a very basic UI but is suitable for the purposes I need.

 When the WebSocketClient connects to the node server, it authenticates the user and waits to receive a Success response from the server.  At this point the WebSocketClient makes a local broadcast that the app connection status has changed.  This is then picked up by the application UI which switches the login fragment for the chat fragment.  Whenever messages are received, the WebSocketClient processes it and pushes the new message onto the chatLog which is stored in the GlobalData class.  A local broadcast that a new message has been received is then pushed which again is picked up by the activity which triggers a refresh of the chat log text view.

 When the user presses the back button, the WebSocketClient sends a disconnect request to the server and the application is closed.

 There are many things I could tweak which from an application perspective would make more sense, customize websocket server address in settings, save username and password, adjust the UI itself to make it better, but for now the application serves its purpose just great.

 I am happy with the progress that is being made.
